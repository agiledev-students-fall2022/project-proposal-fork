# Project Proposal
## Project Title
Working title: Got2Go!

###### What and Why?
The accessibility of free public restrooms and the knowledge of where to find them is a concern all of us have when we are visiting a place like a bustling city. And when we do have to go, we frantically search in nearby shops, parks, and restaurants for access, all while sacrificing our health and time. 

We all have to use the restroom multiple times a day, so why not make it easier to find one?

This product seeks to do just that by showing users public restrooms that are closest to their geographical location.

###### For whom?
This product is for anyone who needs to find a public restroom and has access to a device. 

###### How?
The product will offer the user an interactive map of public restrooms based on their current geographical location. These will be displayed as icons that users can click on to view information such as:
- Address of location
- Accessibility features (open/closed,requirement of key, disability access, changing rooms, gender-specific restrooms, etc.)
- User comments relating to cleanliness, safety, rating, etc.

There are three ways that I think this project can be implemented: a website, an extension on a dedicated maps platform, or a full-form mobile application. 

###### Scope
For now, this project should start with a major city like New York and then scale up so that more users can benefit from this product.

The challenge will be to create a front-end graphical user interface that allows users to interact with a map and make comments. A team of 4-6 should be able to solve this, however, in a semester.
